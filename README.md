First you have to upload the dataset_tweets_WHO.txt to your environment. 
To run de code you have to execute all the cells, changing the docs_path if you have uploaded the dataset to another one.
Firstly you will be asked to insert a query. This one is not used for the rest of the project, but it is necessary to check that create_index and search functions are working correctly.

Then, you will have to insert 5 queries. You will see the top 10 results of each them, and they will be used to do the evaluation part, i.e. to calculate Precision@K (P@K), Average Precision@K (P@K), Mean Average Precision (MAP), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). 

In order to check correctly how our project works, as we have decided for each query which document is relevant or not in a binary way, you will have to insert the following queries:

1: covid pandemic
2: global health
3: support of other countries
4: people access to vaccine
5: people need care

If you insert other queries, you will have to decide for them which documents are relevant or not.
